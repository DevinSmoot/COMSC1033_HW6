##  Introduction:
 This week we worked on a game involving 4 rounds. Each round has increasing difficulty as long as a correct answer is entered. Points are added once a correct answer is given. If an incorrect answer is given then the difficulty is decreased as well as the score.
 
## Code:
```java

		//	IF correct
		if (studentAnswer == correctAnswer){

			//Add points
			score += 2;
			//Show score
			System.out.println("Two points gained!");
			System.out.println("Score: " + score);
			//Increase hardness of the question
			hardnessOfQuestion *= 10;
		}else{
			//State that answer is incorrect
			System.out.println("Answer was not correct");
			//Remove points
			score -= 1;
			//Show score
			System.out.println("The correct answer was: " + correctAnswer);
			System.out.println("A point was lost!");
			System.out.println("Score: " + score);
			//Decrease hardness of the question while checking to make sure
			//it is at always 10 at the lowest level.
			if (hardnessOfQuestion == 10){
				hardnessOfQuestion = 10;
			}else{
				hardnessOfQuestion /= 10;
			}
		}
	}
	System.out.println ("\nThanks for playing!");
	System.out.println ("Your final score is: " + score);
	}
}
```

## Summary:
This weekâ€™s assignment allowed me to utilize FOR loops. I also go to validate input to verify it was an actual integer and not something else such as a letter or decimal. By utilizing the FOR loop allowed me to shrink the entire size of the program. As I could have 4 duplicate rounds or 1 round that increases the needed variables as it goes. Being able to validate the integer on input allows me to eliminate input instructions and keep the program from crashing. 

So a step by step of the program is as follow:

    1.  The integers are initiated and set
    2.	Game is described as well as rules.
    3.	The FOR loop begins (limited to 4 rounds)
    4.	Number1 is randomized based on hardnessOfQuestion
    5.	Number2 is randomized based on hardnessOfQuestion
    6.	CorrectAnswer is calculated by adding the two numbers together. This will be used to evaluate the users answer later on.
    7.	A DO loop is used to take the input from the user. It is then validated. If it fails then it takes a new input and validates again until a good integer is input.
    8.	An IF statement is next utilized to evaluate the users answer against the correctAnswer.
    9.	If a correct answer is given then points are added and hardnessOfQuestion is increased.
    10.	If an incorrect answer is given then points are taken away and hardnessOfQuestion is decreased. If hardnessOfQuestion is already 10 then it stays at 10.
    11.	This loops and continues for all four rounds.
    12.	At the end of all four rounds a message thanking the player for playing and a final score is printed.
